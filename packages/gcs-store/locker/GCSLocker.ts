/**
 * Google Cloud Storage implementation of the Locker mechanism with support for distribution.
 * For general information regarding Locker, see MemoryLocker.
 *
 * Locking is based on separate .lock files created in a GCS bucket (presumably the same as the upload destination, but not necessarily). Concurrency control is ensured by metageneration preconditions. Release mechanism is based on separate .release files. After a lock file is created, we regularly check if another process requested releasing the lock (by creating the release file). To avoid resources being locked forever, each lock's metadata is regularly updated, this way we can make sure the locker process haven't crashed.
 *
 * Lock file health - possible states of a lock file:
 * - non-existing (not locked)
 * - healthy (locked)
 * - requested to be released (locked, but should be released soon)
 * - expired (not locked)
 *
 * Acquiring a lock:
 * - If the lock file does not exist yet, create one with an expiration time and start watching it (see below)
 * - If the lock file already exists
 * -- If it has expired, delete it and restart the process
 * -- If it is active, request releasing the resource by creatin the .release file, then retry locking with an exponential backoff
 *
 * Releasing a lock:
 * Stop the watcher and delete the lock/release files.
 *
 * Watching a lock (performed in every `watchInterval` ms):
 * - If the lock file does not exist anymore, or its created by a different process, stop the watcher
 * - If the lock file still exists
 * -- Update its expiration time
 * -- If a release file exists, call the cancel handler
 *
 * The implementation is based on 'A robust distributed locking algorithm based on Google Cloud Storage' by Hongli Lai (https://www.joyfulbikeshedding.com/blog/2021-05-19-robust-distributed-locking-algorithm-based-on-google-cloud-storage.html).
